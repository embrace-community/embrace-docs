# Founding Philosophy

Community is central to who we are as human beings: humanity is our community. They have been with us since the beginning, before computers, before the internet. They are the foundation of our existence and they are the foundation of our survival. Sovereign, decentralised communities are vital if we are to overcome the current ecological, economical & geopolitical challenges that humanity is facing.

Healthy and strong communities are the foundation to a healthy humanity.

Community is the product of creativity and collaboration.

Increasing threats of censorship, surveillance, and control are undermining the ability of communities to thrive.

Responsibility for the use of technological power. It can destroy our societies or help us thrive.
