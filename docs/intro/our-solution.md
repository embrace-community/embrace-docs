# Our Solution

**How best can we express the values of community in the new era of the web?**

Community First: Our primary goal is to nurture healthy communities. To do this, we need to provide tools that support Creativity and Collaboration. Helping Creatives build communities around their content and enabling DAOs to collaborate in order to achieve their goals.

**Decentralisation** is central to this vision.

- Infrastructure: of the tools used
- Ownership: of the platform
- Decision Making: through a DAO
- Contributions: from the wider community

**Ultimately our solution must Unite people within their communities instead of divide them.**
