# Our Solution

Curation instead of censorship
Built in such a way that use is permission-less so we cannot stop anyone adding data to Embrace. We can curate and choose not to index certain spaces if the DAO agrees that they are not suitable / illegal. There is nothing to stop anyone using Embrace and anyone can create a space and host it on their own site without the need to access the Embrace site.
