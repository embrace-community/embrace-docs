# Current Problem

Distorted by profit motivation: the primary goal is profit not community.

Survelliance Capitalism is a term coined by Shoshana Zuboff to describe the new
form of capitalism that has emerged in the digital age. It is a system in which
the primary goal is not to serve the community but to extract as much profit as
possible from the it. This is done by exploiting the community's data
and by manipulating the community's behavior.

Tracking, advertisements, manipulating behaviour to encourage more use. Not concerned with the health of individuals or the communities they are part of.

Centralised, monopoly over data. Deplatforming. Censoring.

All profit generated is centralised by the owners of the platform instead of decentralised among the user's of the platform which contribute to the content of the community.
