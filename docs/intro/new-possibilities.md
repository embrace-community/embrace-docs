# A New Possibility

<!-- Curation instead of censorship -->

- Community first / Non-profit
  - The primary aim is to support communities in the new era of the web
  - Any profit made by the platform will go back into supporting communities
  - All revenue a community generates is it's own, and goes directly to them. They can choose if they wish to pay fees to maintain the sustainability of the Embrace community DAO. How this will be incentivised / encrouraged.
- No advertising
  - None will be used, so no tracking of behaviours / manipulation
  - Communities will be able to promote themselves on the platform
- Decentralisation
  - All infrastructure
  - Ownership
  - Decision making
  - Curation instead of censorship
- Open Source
- Community decision making
  - DAO

Built in such a way that use is permission-less so we cannot stop anyone adding data to Embrace. We can curate and choose not to index certain spaces if the DAO agrees that they are not suitable / illegal. There is nothing to stop anyone using Embrace and anyone can create a space and host it on their own site without the need to access the Embrace site.
