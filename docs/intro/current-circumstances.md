# Current Circumstance

Distorted by profit motivation: the primary goal is profit not community.

Does not prioritise the health of individuals or communities on the platform. The implementation often profits from toxic communication and benefits from altercations.

Survelliance Capitalism is a term to describe the new
form of capitalism that has emerged in the digital age. It is a system in which
the primary goal is not to serve the community but to extract as much profit as
possible from the it. This is done by exploiting the community's data
and by manipulating the community's behavior.

Tracking, advertisements, manipulating behaviour to encourage more use. Not concerned with the health of individuals or the communities they are part of.

Centralised, monopoly over data. De-platforming. Censoring.

All profit generated is centralised by the owners of the platform instead of decentralised among the user's of the platform which contribute to the content of the community.

- Profit first
  - community second - metrics to measure profit but not health of communities
  - Profit generated is given to owners and not users
- Surveillance capitalism -> advertising -> Manipulation of behaviour
- Centralisation
  - Monopoly of information
  - Censorship
  - Abuse of power
- Closed source
  - Code is not publicly available
  - Algorithms used against the individual without knowledge of how they work
- Private decision making
  - Decision making does not invole the community
