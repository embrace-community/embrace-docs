# Current Problem

The problem we see is that Social Media has become a distorted expression of community.
These platforms are often more focused on revenue than being aligned with the true values of community.

The business model of these platforms is centred around surveillance capitalism which profits through harvesting and selling the information of itâ€™s users. Only a small portion of profit is shared amongst the communities that use the platform.

These organisations are always centralised, giving them absolute power and making censorship common place. This disempowers content creators as they can lose their community instantly if they are de-platformed.

- Profit first and Community second
- Surveillance capitalism -> Advertisement model -> Manipulation of behaviour
- Centralisation
  - Monopoly of information
  - Censorship
  - Abuse of power
- Closed source
  - Code is not publicly available
  - Algorithms used against the individual without knowledge of how they work
- Private decision making
  - Decision making does not invole the community
