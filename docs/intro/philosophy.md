# Founding Philosophy

Community is central to who we are as human beings; it has been with us since the beginning of our species and it is the foundation of our civilisation. Sovereign, decentralised communities are vital if we are to overcome the current ecological, economical & geopolitical challenges that humanity is facing.

We are at a pivotal moment in human history and communities will play a vital role in meeting the new opportunities and challenges that face us in the 21st century.

Creativity and Collaboration are the pillars that hold communities together and it is important that we have platforms that prioritise and nuture these activities in order to create healthy communities.

<!-- Healthy and strong communities are the foundation to a healthy humanity.

Community is the product of creativity and collaboration.

Increasing threats of censorship, surveillance, and control are undermining the ability of communities to thrive.

Responsibility for the use of technological power. It can destroy our societies or help us thrive. -->
