# Founding Philosophy

Community is central to who we are as human beings. Community has been with us since the beginning, before computers and before the internet. They are the foundation of our civilisation and they are also the foundation of our survival. Sovereign, decentralised communities are vital if we are to overcome the current ecological, economical & geopolitical challenges that humanity is facing.

We are at a pivotal moment in human history and community will play a vital role in meeting the new opportunities and challenges that face us in the 21st century and beyond.

Creativity and Collaboration are the pillars that communitues grow around and it is important that we have platforms that prioritise and nuture these pillars in order to create healthy communities.

<!-- Healthy and strong communities are the foundation to a healthy humanity.

Community is the product of creativity and collaboration.

Increasing threats of censorship, surveillance, and control are undermining the ability of communities to thrive.

Responsibility for the use of technological power. It can destroy our societies or help us thrive. -->
