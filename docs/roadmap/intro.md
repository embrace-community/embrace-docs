# Current Progress

- Mobile App, Embrace DAO, Embrace Token, Decentralised Community Nodes, Decentralise Pinning (Nodes PIN all, every member with app PINs all the metadata files for their spaces etc), Decentralised sites: (Method to allow domains to point directly to space using \_dnsLink)

- Adoption strategy: Gaseless transactions (paid for on low cost network such as Polygon or NEAR), Mobile App - non-crypto users can begin using the app in the same way as any other mobile app. Wallet is managed in the background and fees for transactions are taken care of.
